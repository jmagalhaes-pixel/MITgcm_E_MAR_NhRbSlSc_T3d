function [ Pxx, Pyy, Pxy, coh, pha, freq ] = func_coherence( f1, f2, win, n_overlap, nfft, Fs )

%
% Computing power spectrum, cross spectrum, coherence and phase
%
% All input parameters are equivalent to csd or the other spectrum 
% related function in MATLAB.
%
% This program use csd.m in Signal Processing Toolbox.
%
% Input
%	f1 and f2	input data
%	nfft		number of data for FFT; default = 256
%	Fs          sampling frequency; default = 1 Hz
%	win		(=window) filter vector, hanning(nfft/2)
%	n_overlap	number of overlap for smoothing
%
% Output
%	Pxx		spectrum of f1
%	Pyy		spectrum of f2
%	Pxy		cross spectrum between f1 and f2
%	coh		coherence
%	pha		phase
%	freq		frequency vector

% Comments: check it with two aboslutely identical sinusoidal waves of any frequenciy (let say) - 50 hz ... - and you will be surprized... - it doesn't work as Matlab standart function - 'cohere' or 'mscohere'(for version 7.0)

% Comments: I agree. Simple, but just what I was looking for, since I wasn't aware of how to compute phase. A minor improvement would be to allow the user to ignore the filt and n_overlap inputs, just as one can do with the csd.m function.

%I got it to produce the same output as mscohere by replacing csd with cpsd.
%I also wasn't clear how to calculate phase. func_coherence.m makes that clear to me. Thanks.
